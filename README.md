## Kubernetes for Developers (LFD259) Study Notes

To run Kubernetes locally on your laptop you have more than one option, e.g. see:
- [Small Kubernetes for your local experiments](https://blog.flant.com/small-local-kubernetes-comparison/)
- [Setting up a Kubernetes cluster](https://www.armosec.io/blog/setting-up-kubernetes-cluster/)

If you are using an Ubuntu-based distro deploy single-node Kubernetes instances with `MicroK8s` on virtual machines launched with `multipass` could be the best solution (see [setup.sh](setup.sh)).

Additional resources you will need to setup in your cluster to simulate the official course environment:
- a SSH-tunnel to reach from your laptop the service exposed from the cluster passing through the host system: `ssh -L local-port:multipass-master-ip:web-service-port -N -f username@ssh-server-ip`
- a userland implementation of NFSv3 like `unfsd` (see [CreateUNFS.sh](CreateUNFS.sh)): bu it can be tricky, since you are not allowed two turn multipass instances into LXD privileged containers
  - alternatively, consider to just mount a directory from the host as follows: `multipass mount -u $UID:1000 ckad/ master:/mnt`
