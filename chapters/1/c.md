## Networking

A Pod represents a group of co-located containers with some associated data volumes. All containers in a Pod share the same network namespace.

The diagram below shows a pod with two containers, MainApp and Logger, and two data volumes, made available under two mount points. Containers MainApp and Logger share the network namespace of a third container, known as the pause container. The pause container is used to get an IP address, then all the containers in the pod will use its network namespace. You wonâ€™t see this container from the Kubernetes perspective, but you would by running `sudo docker ps`.

A container orchestration system must address three networking issues:

- coupled container-to-container communication (solved by the Pod concept)
- pod-to-pod communication
- external-to-pod communication

The Service object is used to connect Pods within the same network using `ClusterIP` adresses, from outside of the cluster using `NodePort` addresses, and using a load balancer if configured with a `LoadBalancer` service.

An Ingress Controller or a service mesh like Istio can also be used to connect traffic to a Pod.
