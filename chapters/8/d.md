## Conformance Testing

The **cncf.io** group is in the process of formalizing what is considered to be a conforming Kubernetes cluster. While that project matures there is an existing tool provided by **Heptio** which can be useful: [Sonobuoy](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy) is a diagnostic tool that makes it easier to understand the state of a Kubernetes cluster by running a set of plugins (including Kubernetes conformance tests) in an accessible and non-destructive manner. It is a customizable, extendable, and cluster-agnostic way to generate clear, informative reports about your cluster.
