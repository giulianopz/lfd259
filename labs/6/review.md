1. Create a new deployment which uses the nginx image.
```
k create deployment review-six --image=nginx
```

2. Create a new **LoadBalancer** service to expose the newly created deployment. Test that it works:
```
k expose deployment review-six --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=review-six-svc --type=LoadBalancer
```

3. Create a new **NetworkPolicy** called `netblock` which blocks all traffic to pods in this deployment only. Test that all traffic is blocked to deployment::
```
vi netblock.yaml
# apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
# kind: NetworkPolicy
# metadata:
#   name: netblock
#   namespace: default
# spec:
#   podSelector:
#     matchLabels:
#       app: review-six
#   policyTypes:
#   - Ingress
k create -f netblock.yaml
curl http://<CLUSTER-IP>:80
> curl: (28) Failed to connect to <CLUSTER-IP> port 80: Connection timed out
```

4. Update the netblock policy to allow traffic to the pod on port 80 only. Test that you can access the default nginx web page:
```
vi netblock.yaml
# apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
# kind: NetworkPolicy
# metadata:
#   name: netblock
#   namespace: default
# spec:
#   podSelector:
#     matchLabels:
#       app: review-six
#   policyTypes:
#   - Ingress
#   ingress:
#   - ports:
#     - port: 80
k replace -f netblock.yaml
curl http://<CLUSTER-IP>:80

```

5. Find and use the security-review1.yaml file to create a pod:
```
k create -f security-review1.yaml
```

6. View the status of the pod:
```
k get pods
> NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
> securityreview               0/1     Error     2 (22s ago)     32s
```

7. Use the following commands to figure out why the pod has issues.
```
k get pod securityreview
k describe pod securityreview
k logs securityreview
```

8. After finding the errors, log into the container and find the proper id of the nginx user:
```
k delete pod securityreview
vi security-review1.yaml
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: securityreview
# spec:
#   securityContext:
#     runAsUser: 2100
#   containers:
#   - name:  webguy
#     image: nginx
#     command:
#       - tail
#       - "-f"
#       - /dev/null
#     securityContext:
#       runAsUser: 3000
#       allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
k craete -f security-review1.yaml
k exec -it securityreview -- /bin/sh
$ cat /proc/1/status
> Name:   tail
> Umask:  0022
> State:  S (sleeping)
> Tgid:   1
> Ngid:   0
> Pid:    1
> PPid:   0
> TracerPid:      0
> Uid:    3000    3000    3000    3000
```

9.  Edit the yaml and re-create the pod such that the pod runs without error:
```
vi security-review1.yaml
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Pod
# metadata:
#   name: securityreview
# spec:
#   securityContext:
#     runAsUser: 1000
#   containers:
#   - name:  webguy
#     image: nginx
#     securityContext:
#       runAsUser: 0
k create -f security-review1.yaml
```

That should be considered only a workaround since running nginx as a non-root user require some [changes](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/nginx#running-nginx-as-a-non-root-user) to the server configuration.

10.  Create a new **ServiceAccount** called `securityaccount`
```
k create serviceaccount securityaccount
```

11. Create a **ClusterRole** named `secrole` which only allows create, delete, and list of pods in all apiGroups:
```
vi secrole.yaml
# apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# kind: ClusterRole
# metadata:
#   name: secrole
# rules:
# - apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
#   resources: ["pods"]
#   verbs: ["create", "delete", "list"]
k create -f secrole.yaml
```

12. Bind the clusterRole to the serviceAccount:
```
vi secbinding.yaml
# apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# kind: ClusterRoleBinding
# metadata:
#   name: securitybinding
# subjects:
# - kind: ServiceAccount
#   name: securityaccount
#   namespace: default
# roleRef:
#   kind: ClusterRole
#   name: secrole
#   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

```

13. Locate the token of the securityaccount.  Create a file called `/tmp/securitytoken`. Put only the value of `token:` is equal to, a long string that may start with `eyJh` and be several lines long. Careful that only that string exists in the file:
```
k get secret <securityaccount-token-name> -o yaml | grep -Po '(?<=token: ).*' > /tmp/securitytoken
```

14. Remove any resources you have added during this review:
```
for i in *.yaml; do k delete -f $i; done
k delete deployments.apps review-six
```
